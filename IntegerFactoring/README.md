# Integer Factoring Example

## About

In high school algebra, to factor numbers for various equations a graphing, we're taught to use the [Trial Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division) method.
While overall this is easier than an equation, I've always struggled to use this method.

Due to this, I began researching different factorization algorithms, and decided to learn them by implementing them into different
programming languages.

## Algorithms

The algorithms I will be covering with examples are the following:

* [Trial Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division)
* [Wheel Factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_factorization)
* And more coming soon...

### Misc.

If you find any issues with any of the implementations I present, please feel free to fix them and make a PR.
